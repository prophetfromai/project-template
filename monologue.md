# Monologue

A short, rolling log of what people are thinking about, working on, and kicking around for this project — captured in the moment, not polished after the fact.

## Format

Each entry is one line: **who said it**, **what they said** (very few words), and **what it relates to** (feature, idea, or theme). Newest at the top.
