## What This Project Is

{One sentence: what it does and who it's for.}

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # local dev server
npm run build      # production build
npm run deploy     # deploy to Firebase
```

## Monologue

`monologue.md` is this repo's rolling log of what people are thinking, asking about, and working on — captured in very few words. It gives any Claude session a sense of recent context before jumping in.

**Reading:** Scan `monologue.md` at the start of strategic or directional conversations.

**Writing:** When someone raises an idea, changes direction, or expresses intent — append a one-liner to the top of the log:
```
- [YYYY-MM-DD] Name: the gist in very few words — theme/feature
```

Only capture signal: ideas, shifts in direction, decisions. Skip routine implementation chatter.

For the portfolio-level monologue (cross-product ideas and themes), see `/Users/qualitydrivensoftwareltd/git/director/monologue.md`.
